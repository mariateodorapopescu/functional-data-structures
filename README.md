# Haskell Binomial Heap

 This project is a journey into the application of functional mechanisms, types, and lazy evaluation, offering you a hands-on experience in building a priority queue.

## Objectives

- Apply functional programming mechanisms, including types and lazy evaluation in Haskell.
- Delve into the efficiency of data structures in a functional paradigm.

## Overview

This project unfolds in three stages, each building on the knowledge gained in the previous weeks. From binary numbers to binomial heaps, you'll discover the beauty of functional solutions.

### Stage 1: Binary Numbers

Get ready by tackling operations on binary numbers. The BinaryNumber module introduces concepts like converting between binary and decimal, incrementing, decrementing, and multiplying binary numbers.

### Stage 2: Binomial Heaps

In this stage, immerse yourself in the world of binomial trees and heaps. Discover how to efficiently implement a priority queue using binomial heaps. From inserting elements to finding the minimum priority and merging heaps, this stage will sharpen your functional programming skills.

## Getting Started

1. **Stage 1**: Navigate to the BinaryNumber module, complete the TODOs, and run tests using TestBinaryNumber.

2. **Stage 2**: Head to the BinomialHeap module, tackle the TODOs, and test your implementations using TestBinomialHeap.
